## Project 1: Global Economic Indicators

### Project Overview
This project analyzes global economic indicators for various countries, focusing on data from 2020. It includes a matrix of key metrics, visualizations such as bar charts and maps, and detailed KPIs to provide insights into economic performance.

### Data Sources
All data in this report comes from the World Bank's World Economic Development database: [World Bank DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org).

#### Specific API Data Sources:
- Population Data: [Total Population](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/sources/2/series/SP.POP.TOTL/metadata?format=JSON)
- GDP Data: [GDP (Constant 2010 US$)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/sources/2/series/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD/metadata?format=JSON)
- GDP Per Capita: [GDP Per Capita (Constant 2010 US$)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/sources/2/series/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD/metadata?format=JSON)
- Country Data: [All Countries](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all?format=JSON&per_page=500)

### Key Features
- **Matrix**: Displays country data including:
  - 2020 Population
  - 2020 GDP
  - 2020 Population Density
  - 2020 GDP Per Capita
  - GDP By Year (using Sparkline)

- **Bar Chart**: Visual representation of the total number of countries by region.

- **Map Visualization**: An orthographic map displaying economic indicators by country.

- **Metadata Tab**: Additional context and information about the data used.

- **Country Detail Page**: Interactive page where users can delve into specific country details and KPIs.

### KPIs
- 2020 Population
- 2020 GDP
- 2020 Population Density
- 2020 GDP Per Capita
- Annual Growth Chart: Line graph showing GDP growth percentage, GDP, and annual growth metrics.

## Project 2: P3 Adaptive Consulting Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the P3 Adaptive simulated consulting project. The goal was to create a Power BI data model using the provided Excel data to solve a business challenge.

## Important Note on Report Discrepancies

As part of the simulated consulting project, the original report provided for replication contained intentional discrepancies in the output. These were designed to challenge candidates' analytical skills and ability to identify and resolve inconsistencies.

### Key Points:
- The inaccuracies may relate to specific metrics, calculations, or visualizations.
- Candidates were expected to critically evaluate the provided data and identify areas needing correction.
- This aspect of the project was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of attention to detail and problem-solving in data analysis.

In my approach, I took the time to thoroughly investigate these discrepancies and ensure my final report accurately reflects the correct metrics and insights.
