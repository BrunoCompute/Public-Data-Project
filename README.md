# Veterans Data Visualization Dashboard

Welcome to the comprehensive Veterans Data Dashboard! This page provides insightful visualizations designed to explore the projected and actual veteran population trends from **September 2023 to September 2053**. The interactive and accessible visuals help users better understand the gender distribution, age demographics, and overall veteran population changes over time. Here's an overview of the key features on this page:

## Key Visuals

### Gender Representation Cards (KPI)
Simple cards display the current veteran population split by gender, with pink representing female veterans and blue representing male veterans where applicable.

### Total Veterans Over Time (SVG Line Chart)
This sleek SVG line chart tracks the total veteran population over time, from **September 2023 through September 2053**. It provides a clear view of the overall trends in veteran numbers across the years.

### Gender Breakdown (Donut Chart)
The gender breakdown donut chart visually represents the male and female veteran population, with gender icons at the center for easy reference. The chart highlights the percentage distribution of veterans by gender.

### Yearly Veteran Data by Gender (Line and Clustered Column Chart)
This chart offers a detailed comparison of the veteran population over time, split by gender. The Y-axis represents the sum of veterans, while the column segments display gender breakdowns. The option to toggle between actual and projected data allows for both current and future insights.

### Age Group Funnel Chart
This eye-catching funnel chart breaks down the veteran population by age groups. The chart is sorted by age, with group totals displayed on the left of the funnel. Numbers are displayed directly on the bars, with several options available for display:
- **Percentage of First Stage**: Shows the percentage compared to the largest group.
- **Percentage of Previous Stage**: Displays the percentage change from the previous age group.
- **Change Over Stages**: Compares the veteran count from one stage to the next.

#### Funnel Data Examples:

##### Percentage of First Stage:
- **Age Group 75 to 79**: Count: **2,298k** - **% of First: 100%**
- **Age Group 60 to 64**: Count: **1,836k** - **% of First: 80%**
- **Age Group 70 to 74**: Count: **1,772k** - **% of First: 77%**
- **Age Group 65 to 69**: Count: **1,707k** - **% of First: 74%**

##### Percentage of Previous Stage:

- **Age Group 65 to 69**: Count: **1,707k** - **% of Previous Stage: 93%**

##### Change in Veteran Population:
- **Age Group 75 to 79**: Count: **2,298k** - **Change: +526k** (Baseline)
- **Age Group 60 to 64**: Count: **1,836k** - **Change: +190k**
- **Age Group 70 to 74**: Count: **1,772k** - **Change: +65k**

## Project 2: P3 Adaptive Consulting Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the P3 Adaptive simulated consulting project. The goal was to create a Power BI data model using the provided Excel data to solve a business challenge.

## Important Note on Report Discrepancies

As part of the simulated consulting project, the original report provided for replication contained intentional discrepancies in the output. These were designed to challenge candidates' analytical skills and ability to identify and resolve inconsistencies.

### Key Points:
- The inaccuracies may relate to specific metrics, calculations, or visualizations.
- Candidates were expected to critically evaluate the provided data and identify areas needing correction.
- This aspect of the project was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of attention to detail and problem-solving in data analysis.

In my approach, I took the time to thoroughly investigate these discrepancies and ensure my final report accurately reflects the correct metrics and insights.
